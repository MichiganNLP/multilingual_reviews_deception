English,Ankara,Hotel Cinnah,The rooms are beautiful if having beautiful photos is more important to you than having a comfortable stay.,"We traveled by car with a dog and immediately wrote about it. The hotel told us on the day of check-in at 15:56 (!!!!) that there is an additional charge of 250 TL per day for staying with a dog. There is not a single carpet in the room, only cold tiles. For what the extra charge is not clear. It is also not clear why the hotel did not find a minute during the week to answer us in advance, and not after the check-in time. When I asked why they provided important information after the free cancellation time, they told me (at the front desk) that I could cancel now. Of course, at 10 pm after 6 hours of driving, I will look for another hotel! Absolute disregard for the customer.
There was also no parking space. We were forbidden to stand in front of the hotel, although there were many cars parked there. We were only offered to park the car in the parking lot if we left them the car keys. What is this idea?

After I complaint about the room, they immediately gave us a bigger and much better room. However since the insulation of the windows were not good and our room was at the roadside, it was too noisy because of the traffic. 
The internet connection was very bad. Since I did not have internet on my phone in Turkey, I basically thought that wifi will be fine at the hotel. However it was not working from our room. The wifi was working from the cafe downstairs though.

-I believe the hotel has two options of views was really hoping to spend a nice staycation in a nice hotel room with a view but got a view of a some “Pruitt Igoe” style green ghetto. Was hugely disappointed but too shy to ask for the change and have never been asked if I like it. You know, just a “take it or leave it” attitude. 
-HORRIBLE SOUND ISOLATION IN HALLWAYS was awakened every morning by ppl leaving from other rooms.
- hotel feels old and poorly maintained. Dirty mirrors in the bathroom, no toothbrush splashes but just dusty and with oily fingerprints. The vanity mirror has no light which could be very handy because the whole lighting in the room is a bit too dim. 
- Strange work (let’s put it this way) of shower cabin drainage. No hot water in the sink! Cheap plastic of shower heads in shower cabin, c’mon guys is it a five stars piece of property of a world renowned brand or none air BnB thing? The bath and sink have “Grohe” and the shower has something unpleasant.
- Tiny shower gel, shampoo samples super generic nothing fancy, feels like the hotel wants to save money. Never been asked if I have enough of everything, I was the one who had to ask for things which isn’t comfortable
- Toilet doesn’t flush properly 
- I had to take some notes and grabbed a pen nearby phone and it was broken. So you guys prefer to save on pens rather than keep the reputation of the brand?

All of this would be more understandable if the room was half the price, but we paid $120 US dollars for 1 night, by far the most spent while in China. The staff also didn’t speak English for the most part.

It’s been over 8 days and I’m still waiting for the first authorisation on my credit card to complete and the funds to become available. Because I was paying for 2 rooms it’s $1000AUD which is a big nuisance while travelling. Additionally all the signage in the hotel is in Chinese characters.

English,Beijing,Peking Youth Hostel,Great location close to the subway.,"I was very disappointed in this hostel. When you book the room, you receive a confirmation
message saying that they are happy to help with day trips and tickets, and that you can contact them. I tried many times (both here on Booking.com, on WeChat and via email), but I was ignored. A few days before my arrival I finally got a reply but in Chinese. All communication is done in Chinese. 
When I arrived I asked again for help. The staff misinformed me and sent me to the Forbidden City to buy tickets, which is not possible. They need to help you, because as a foreigner you cannot book yourself without a Chinese phone number and WeChat Pay or Alipay. So I spent several hours hunting a ticket that I couldn’t get! In the end another staff member helped me, but they do not seem ready to help foreigners at all. I also booked a trip to Mutanyiu Great Wall via the hostel, and the tour was fine, but it was very difficult to follow what was happening. It was an all Chinese tour for Chinese, and it was a bit uncomfortable not knowing what was happening (e.g. should we get out when the bus stops? what time should we be back at the bus? why do need to pay additional money to the guide?). 
Also the room was only okay. The bed was very hard (like most places in China, but yet this one was the most uncomfortable bed on our 1 month trip). Housekeeping meant putting the dirty towels back and not making the bed nor providing new shampoo. No breakfast to be found around either and the cafe next door only opens at 11 AM. 
I was definitely expecting more for the 760 RMB I was paying per night. We stayed for 6 nights and I cannot recommend it. There must be a better and cheaper option out there!",5,NEG

Impossible to vent out with privacy, since there are neighbors across who can look right into the room. A/C was not working at all. The hallways appear dirty and old.
They have an automated checkin system that doesn't work, and upon asking the person at the desk for help, they only very reluctantly spent the 20 seconds registering a key card which made it feel like you were being a hassle in their day instead of a valued guest. Not a great welcome.",4,NEG

English,Bucharest,"The Marmorosch Bucharest, Autograph Collection","Hotel location is very good.
Hotel rooms are really good. We stayed in suite with balcony.
Breakfast was very good.
Bar stuff and restaurant were super friendly and helpful. I would like to point out Ukrainian girl in the bar and Marian the head waiter. 
Gabriel,who helped us with bags was very friendly and during our stay would greet us and have a lovely chat with us !","I have stayed in so many 5 star hotels but I have never met such a bad reception and concierge stuff in my all travels!
We stayed from Friday till late Monday afternoon.
When we arrived receptionist was cold and unfriendly , we just did not feel welcomed.
When we went to our room (we stayed in suite with balcony) and saw a greeting card and fruit platter and cake platter . When we looked opened the greeting card we say that it was intended for a totally different customer Mr. X and it looked that the gift platter wasn't fresh anyway so I am guessing no one bothered to clean it up from previous stay? 
When we walked down to the reception and gave reception guy this card he took it laughed ,told its not for us and did not even apologies. By the time we came back to our room in early evening to get ready, fruit platter was taken away. I guess that we were not as Important as previous person so we did not get any greeting card or fruit platter. 
On Saturday morning, when we were getting ready to head out I noticed that we did not have any tea spoons or tea bags in our room. When I walked and asked reception that we are missing basic things in our room he promised it will be delivered, again no apology ,but rather annoyed bothering him. It took them more than 24 hours to delivery two spoons and tea bags to the room, they tried to tell us that they have and we just did not see them and etc, they only delivered after 5 complaints and me loosing my patience ) 
Overall the hotel itself is good (rooms, design, bar) but the reception stuff is absolutely horrible. 
I can only recommend to stay in this hotel if you dont need anything from reception otherwise it will be unpleasant experience.
Our friends are going to Romania soon and we will definitely tell them to stay away from the hotel and just visit the bars within the hotel.",4,NEG

English,Bucharest,Central Guesthouse,It was very OK the fact that I could communicate with tre responsable of the hotel in case of emergency/problem. She was very nice (in writing - WhatsApp as way of communication) and she solved the issue soon.,"1. The room was never cleaned and the sheets and towels never changed during the week I stayed at the hotel. 
2. The waste was never took off during my stay. 
3. In my second day of stay, the water was colder and colder until the third day when it was very cold (frozen). The next day, the problem was solved (I had had writen to the hotel responsable the day before.). 
4. I think the room's main door wasn't of very good quality, so that I heard every step in the main hall. At the point that I was waked up in the morning many times by that noise. (neighbors leaving their rooms)
5. I find it very impolite that in my last day of stay, at 10:08am (!!) the cleaning lady came to my door to tell me I should have left the room at 10am. Firstly, isn't it an European convention that we must leave the hotel room by 12am? Anyhow, this is what Booking put in my calendar as ""leaving time"". Secondly, why did she bother me at 8 minutes (!!) after 10am? And especially after never cleaning my room for one week. 
6. Concerning the taxi. When I did the reservation on Booking, I was let known that a drive from the airport to the hotel was included in the price. I accepted the offer and I received the necessary information (taxi driver's name, his phone number and the fact that he will be there once the plane has landed - Bookong had my flight information - and that he will be waiting for me for maximum 45 min.). Well, 10min after I leave the plane, the taxi driver calls me to tell me that he will have 20min of delay as he had done another drive before). I find this disrespectful for the client.

They were incredibly friendly, accommodating, and always had a smile on their faces. They were also helpful in providing recommendations for family-friendly activities and attractions in Rome.

The attendants were great!! Very service oriented and ready to help. Overall the rooms designs where the same. Loved the light configurations. You could turn the room light off from your bed or the wall. After traveling for 6 weeks, it was a blessing to have a nice sized shower in very nice bathroom. Loved the closet space, prompting me to actually put up my clothes. The TV and cable were excellent with a selection of CNN and BBC news channels. Plus the wonderful veranda / garden for breakfast or an evening cocktail, just amazing. Overall I thought a great location, in a NOT TOO hectic area, that makes for a nice starting point if for business or leisure traveler. However, my treatment as a single traveler was not as good. Read below.","My biggest problem was how I was treated as a single / lone female traveler. Firsthad booked this 3 night stay, 8 weeks before arriving. When I arrived I was put into a room that took 3 different stairwells and 2 elevators to get to. The last elevator was a single private one that went to the floor with only 3 rooms. Though in the back of the hotel, I LOVED the room. It was a basic double bed room. It had a desk area, was on the 3rd or 4th floor, great light, and I could open the curtains / the door to a view of rooftops. However, the maze of stairs, elevators, and remoteness was a bit unsettling and also cumbersome when coming back and forth. So I decided to ask for a room change.
The woman who checked me in at the desk was still there and great. She said no problem we could do it that night or the next day. I went to dinner. When I came back there was a new woman - different attitude. She said she understood I was not happy with the room. I explained it was not the room, but the access / location. I even said I don’t need to be on a different floor, it’s just as a single woman I did not feel comfortable in an area where my only access was a private elevator. She now said it was better to move in the morning she had no rooms. Though I had seen many being turned over. The next morning with bags packed, I was ready to move. Instead I was told I could go on my day and they would move me to my new room. This was GREAT!!
When I got back and walked into the new room, I felt like I had been PUNISHED for wanting to feel safe. I was put into a smaller room, on the first floor courtyard. Everything was smaller. No coffee packets, even my mini bar in the refrigerator was now just 2 bottles of water. And the location, literally someone could have jumped right into my window from the courtyard if the window was open. And because the window faced the courtyard, even if the window was open, there was barely LIGHT.",4,NEG

Location was ok, as was the grill. That made may stay bearable. The receptionist was NO help, upon checkin. She couldn't tell me anything about available parking, as specified on website.

English,Washington,Glover Park Hotel Georgetown,The hotel location was close to the Georgetown.,"The room fell far below our expectations considering its price and the reviews we had read. Throughout our trip, we had to stay at two different places, and upon arriving at the golver park hotel, we were genuinely shocked. The facilities were outdated, and it was disappointing to find that it did not meet the standards of a 4-star hotel or justify the high ratings it had received. The size of the toilet was notably small, and the bathroom lacked a proper door for closure.",4,NEG
English,Washington,Glover Park Hotel Georgetown,Location,I was driving 6hrs before check in. When I got a key and opened the room door I saw an old man on the bed. The staff gave me the key from the room which was already occupant. They replaced the room but that room has only one bed instead of 2. The 3rd room was what I booked. I was so tired and hungry but I spent 40 minutes checking in.,4,NEG
English,Washington,Glover Park Hotel Georgetown,"location is great. clean and nice, little kitchen inside was quite handy for breakfast","we contacted the property couple days in advance and requested a baby crib which wasn’t there at the time of arrival. It was about 11pm the staff couldn’t help us with that since “the room with cribs is locked and keys will be there only at the morning”. My baby is used to sleep by her own in a babybed and that was a very important for us, we payed extra for a hotel with such option. first night was awful and we’ve slept for only about 4hours.
second - garage clearance doesn’t allow big trucks and we had to park 5mins away from the hotel. not a bad thing but it’s very annoying when traveling with kids",4,NEG

The staff was very helpful, kind and professional.","As is custom for hotels today, the mini-bar was not well-received by us due to it combining snacks and water with alcoholic beverages. It is very tempting for a family to grab without realizing the cost until after the sensor was activated and the room is charged. Providing a mini convenience area in the lobby would have offered variety in terms of snacks and would have had a variety of non-alcoholic drinks.

Room was dark - the only window was in an alcove off the room.
At checkout I was charged extra for ""wifi and the tote bag"" despite having prepaid my stay when I booked. There was indeed a tote bag in the room, but I had no need for it and had left it in the room. Every other hotel during my 10-day US trip had included wifi.

English,Washington,Riggs Washington DC,Cafe Riggs and the location were definitely the positives.,"The room was not at all what I booked. They asked upon check in if I had visited before and I stated no and I believe they used that to give me a sub-par room. I had ordered a deluxe room, which was supposed to have a marble walk-in shower and additional room than a standard room, but our room was very small and there was definitely not a marble walk-in shower; it had a gross bathtub/shower combo. On top of which, I locked in a rate and somehow I am being charged additional money than what I booked the room. Overall, it was very disappointing.

-Stayed the first weekend in July, king size room approx $180+$30 facility fee +$30 taxes=$240 per night (US$ of course)
-completely outdated hotel in a desperate need of renovation
-had to be moved to another room because the bathroom ceiling was flaking due to a water damage from the room above (thank you to the amazing front desk employee for moving me into another, more decent room)
-AC in the room was not working-(thank you to the facility engineer for fixing it promptly)
-coffee machine in the room was not working-didn't even bother to get if fixed after everything
-no fridge in the room-in 21 century, that should not even be a topic for discussion
-wi-fi log in required every 24 hrs-no idea what is the logic behind this
-room access card had to be validated almost daily

I told her to cancel the reservation and tried to find something else on Bookings.com but it was impossible and I had to meet a colleague soon, so when another person came to the desk I spoke with him. He apologized and said ""she's new"" and that the $300 was held for incidentals but is refunded at checkout and this should have been explained. I checked in and paid to upgrade. For a week coming and going by the front desk the woman never looked me in the eye much less apologized. When I checked out I recounted the story to the guy at the desk and he was dismissive and a bit hostile like he was putting up with ""another privileged jerk"" or whatever and then mischaracterized the $300 as applying to the cost of my room upgrade (which was untrue, it had already been added to the charge and the $300 was on top of that). The staff do not know how to explain the hotel's policies, are very rude if the customer objects, and emit a vibe like they can just barely tolerate the clientele. Very unprofessional.

A bit disappointing was that my room did not have a mini fridge. I would have liked to cool my water and have some yoghurt for my breakfast or have my restaurant leftovers cooled in a fridge.
